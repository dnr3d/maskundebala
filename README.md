A modern, interactive portfolio website for a Senior Graphic Designer, built with React, Vite, and Framer Motion.

## Features

- **Interactive Hero**: Dynamic particle background system.
- **Admin Panel**: Built-in CMS to manage projects, categories, and inquiries (`/admin`).
- **Showcase**: Masonry-style project grid with detailed case study modals.
- **Localization**: Multi-language support (ENG, RUS, KAZ).

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run Development Server**

    ```

3.  **Build for Production**
